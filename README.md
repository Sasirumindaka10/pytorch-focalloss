## üöÄ Overview

This repository provides a straightforward implementation of binary and multi-class focal loss functions in PyTorch. Focal loss is designed to address class imbalance in tasks like object detection and image segmentation. It helps improve the performance of models by focusing more on hard-to-classify examples.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Implementations for both binary and multi-class focal loss.
- Easy integration with existing PyTorch models.
- Support for custom weighting and alpha parameters.
- Extensive test coverage.

## üì• Installation

You can install this package via pip. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher and PyTorch 1.7 or higher installed.

```bash
pip install torch focal_loss
```

Or clone the repository directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sasirumindaka10/pytorch-focalloss.git
cd pytorch-focalloss
pip install -e .
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use focal loss in your training loop, simply import the loss function from the module. Here's how:

### For Binary Classification

```python
import torch
from focal_loss import FocalLoss

# Initialize focal loss
criterion = FocalLoss()

# Example predictions and targets
predictions = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.9, 0.4])
targets = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])

# Compute loss
loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
print(f"Binary Focal Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

### For Multi-Class Classification

```python
import torch
from focal_loss import FocalLoss

# Initialize focal loss with parameters
criterion = FocalLoss(gamma=2.0, alpha=0.25)

# Example predictions and targets
predictions = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.7], [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]])
targets = torch.tensor([2, 0])

# Compute loss
loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
print(f"Multi-Class Focal Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

## üé® Example

Below is a simple example to demonstrate how to use focal loss in a training loop.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from focal_loss import FocalLoss

# Dummy dataset
data = torch.rand(100, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))

# Simple model
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 2),
    nn.Softmax(dim=1)
)

criterion = FocalLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```
